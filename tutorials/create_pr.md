# How to create a Pull Request (PR)

1. Firstly you should create new branch, make some changes and push it to the remote repository (Github).
2. Then you should go to your repo on the Github, chose tab "Pull requests" and press the "New pull request" button.

3. Then you should chose base and source (currently it is named "compare") branch. In our example our target (base) branch is `main`, and source is `how-to_examples`. Base branch is the branch where new changes should be applied, and source is the branch that contains your changes.
